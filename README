## Running Tests

The test program includes various test cases that verify different aspects of the memory allocator.

### To run all tests:
```bash
./my_malloc
```

### To run a specific test (where N is the test number):
```bash
./my_malloc -t N
```

### Test Cases
1. Basic allocation and free
2. Multiple allocations with pattern verification
3. Zero size allocation
4. Realloc functionality
5. Pattern test for large allocations
6. Alternating allocations and frees
7. Heap status verification
8. Minheap ordering
9. Block size metadata
10. Same-size allocations
